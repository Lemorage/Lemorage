  - 👋 I have an active curiosity in exploring new programming languages, especially ones that are based on functional programming paradigms. I have always been fascinated by the skill of writing elegant, productive code.
  - 🚀 I've written programs in a variety of languages, including Java, Go, Rust, C&C++, Python, Ruby, SML, and Scheme, and there will be a lot more. I thrive on the thrill of learning and mastering new programming languages, each providing a unique lens through which to tackle challenges. I have a deep affection for Programming Language Theory (PLT), which guides my approach to creating reliable and expressive solutions.

  - 💻 While I have experience in several areas, my central focus is mostly on web development and different database implementations. I find joy in translating ideas into tangible, efficient, and scalable application programs that make a positive impact.
